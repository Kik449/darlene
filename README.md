# DARLENE
A basic AES-256 cryptographic program for GNU/Linux systems.
## Warning
Darlene is in development phase for now, so no good criptographic practices are ensured.  
For the moment Darlene adds a cero padding so the hash from the decrypted file may differ from the original one.
## Building
For building Darlene from source:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Kik449/darlene
$ cd darlene
$ bash compile.sh
```
A binary will be created in the **build/** directory.
## Future plans
In the future I plan to:
- Add larger files feature
- Add stdin human readable ouput and input feature
## Bugs or requests
Feel free to create a **pull request** or **issue**, everything will be read and taken into account.
## License
